# My Sample Web App Authentication Flows

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of authentication flows for a sample web application using **Next.js** and **Supabase** as the backend authentication provider. The web app includes the following features:

1. **Sign-Up Page**: 
   - Users can sign up using email and password.
   - Users can sign up using Google OAuth.

2. **Login Page**: 
   - Existing users can log in with their credentials.

3. **Forgot Password Page**: 
   - Users can reset their passwords.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication

## Current Status

I have successfully implemented the authentication functionalities as specified in the requirements, including the following:

- User sign-up and login using both email/password and Google OAuth.
- Password reset functionality.

### Challenges Faced

As a newcomer to Tailwind CSS and Supabase, I encountered some challenges that extended the development time, particularly in styling the components and integrating them with Supabase. I initially underestimated the time required to become familiar with these technologies and their implementation.

## Next Steps

Although I completed the core functionalities, I plan to:
- Improve the styling and responsiveness of the user interface using Tailwind CSS.
- Enhance the error handling and edge case scenarios.

## Hosting

The application is hosted on [Netlify](insert your hosted URL here), where you can view the deployed version of the app.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, and I appreciate your understanding regarding the time constraints I faced. I look forward to any feedback and suggestions for improvements.

## Note

Please do not share any sensitive information such as Supabase API keys or Google OAuth client secrets while reviewing this project.

Thank you for your consideration!
